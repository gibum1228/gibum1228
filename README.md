<h1>Who am I?</h1>

Hi, my name is Kim Gi Beom.  
I earned a bachelor's degree from in Korea and majored in computer engineering and software engineering.  
I'm interested in **computer vision** and I was an undergraduate intern at the AI Convergence Laboratory for 1 years.  
My paper was adopted in *IPIU 2022* and this was to solve the problem of online real-time communication between deaf and non-disabled people. Classifiers trained by deep learning translate sign language into English text. If you are curious about other projects, please refer to the resume in the **link table**.  
If you are interested in me, please contact me through email.
