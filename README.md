<h1>Who am I?</h1>

Hi, my name is Kim Gi Beom.  
I earned a bachelor's degree from Sungkonghoe University in Korea and majored in computer engineering and software engineering.  
I am interested in <u>computer vision</u> and I was an undergraduate intern at the AI Convergence Laboratory at SKHU.  
I wrote a paper in IPIU 2022 and the subject was experimented to solve communication problems between deaf and non-disabled people through sign language recognition in an online video conference program. If you are curious about other projects, please refer to the resume in the <u>link table</u>.  
If you are interested in me, please contact me through email.
